Use the globally configured "general record storage page" (aka: "GRSP" or "StoragePid") for author records if "fieldType" is "select". If this is disabled, author records from the completed database will be displayed. EXCEPTIONS: If the selected table is "be_users" the storagePid will be the rootpage (pid=0) and if a value for "StoragePid" (below) is set, the values of "useStoragePid" will be ignored.
